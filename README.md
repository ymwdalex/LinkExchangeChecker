# Link Exchange Checker

Alice and Bob both run their own web-sites. Their business is related, so they have agreed to exchange links. An agreement is OK, but how to make sure that this agreement is working? Web sites get more and more complex every day, plus Alice may be running several sites and has made agreements with many other web-site owners to exchange links. The Link Exchange Checker provides automated way to check for link exchanges.

The Link Exchange Checker (LECh) was developed as an assignment for the course Advanced Web Technology in 2011.
